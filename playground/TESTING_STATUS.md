## 🎯 How to Test Everything

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/mitch/CoW-Playground/services/playground

# Services are already running!
# Just open the UIs:

# Explorer UI
open http://localhost:8083

# CoW Swap UI (with integration)
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Test all explorer features (60+ tests)
./test_explorer_comprehensive.sh

# Test frontend integration
./test_frontend_integration.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Feature Testing

#### Test 1: Latest Feeds
1. Open http://localhost:8083
2. Watch latest blocks update every 2 seconds
3. Watch latest transactions update every 2 seconds
4. ✅ Auto-refresh working

#### Test 2: Search
1. In the search bar, enter: `latest`
2. Should navigate to latest block
3. Try block number: `1`
4. Try an address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
5. ✅ Search working for all types

#### Test 3: Transaction Debugging
1. Click any transaction from latest feed
2. Scroll to "Decoded Input" - should show function name
3. Scroll to "Decoded Logs" - should show events
4. Scroll to "Debug" section:
   - Call Tree - shows nested calls
   - Gas Report - shows gas by contract/function
   - Stepper - adjust From/Size, see opcode execution
5. ✅ All debugging features working

#### Test 4: Address & Verification
1. Click any address
2. See "Is Contract: true/false"
3. See transaction count
4. See recent transactions
5. If verified: see ABI and source code
6. ✅ Address pages working

#### Test 5: Frontend Integration
1. Open http://localhost:8000 (CoW Swap)
2. Look for any transaction or address link
3. Click on it
4. Should open http://localhost:8083 (local explorer)
5. ✅ Integration working via nginx rewrites
