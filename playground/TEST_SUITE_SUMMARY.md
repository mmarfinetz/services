# Explorer Testing Suite - Summary

This document summarizes the testing infrastructure I've created to help you test the new Explorer functionality.

## 📦 What I've Created

### 1. **Automated Test Script** (`test_explorer.sh`)
A comprehensive test suite that validates all Explorer functionality:

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Service health checks (API, Web, Sourcify, Chain)
- ✅ Block retrieval (latest, by number, by hash)
- ✅ Transaction details and receipts
- ✅ Transaction traces (tree and step modes)
- ✅ Search functionality (blocks, txs, addresses)
- ✅ Address information (contract detection, tx count)
- ✅ Web UI page accessibility
- ✅ Data consistency between RPC and Explorer API

**How to use:**
```bash
cd /Users/mitch/CoW-Playground/services/playground
./test_explorer.sh
```

**Output:**
- Colorized pass/fail results
- Detailed error messages
- Summary with counts
- Sample responses for debugging

---

### 2. **Pre-flight Check** (`preflight_check.sh`)
Validates your environment before starting Docker:

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Docker installation and daemon status
- ✅ Docker Compose availability
- ✅ `.env` file existence and required variables
- ✅ Port availability (8081, 8083, 5555, 8545, etc.)
- ✅ Disk space
- ✅ Explorer file structure
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration

**How to use:**
```bash
cd /Users/mitch/CoW-Playground/services/playground
./preflight_check.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `.env.example` if missing
- Lists any missing configuration
- Warns about port conflicts
- Gives clear next steps

---

### 3. **Code Validator** (`validate_code.sh`)
Validates code structure without requiring Docker:

**What it validates:**
- ✅ File structure (all required files present)
- ✅ JSON syntax (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- ✅ TypeScript file structure
- ✅ React component exports
- ✅ Docker Compose service definitions
- ✅ Dockerfile structure
- ✅ Required dependencies

**How to use:**
```bash
cd /Users/mitch/CoW-Playground/services/playground
./validate_code.sh
```

**Output:**
- Detailed check results
- Error/warning categorization
- Summary with counts
- Next steps guidance

## 🚀 Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Code (No Docker Required)
```bash
./validate_code.sh
```
This ensures all files are in place and properly structured.

### Step 2: Check Prerequisites
```bash
./preflight_check.sh
```
This ensures Docker is running, ports are available, and environment is configured.

### Step 3: Start Services
```bash
# Fork mode (mainnet fork)
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml up --build

# OR non-interactive mode (local testnet)
docker compose -f docker-compose.non-interactive.yml up --build
```

### Step 4: Run Automated Tests
In a new terminal:
```bash
./test_explorer.sh
```

### Step 5: Manual Testing
Follow the checklist in `TESTING_QUICKSTART.md` or detailed guide in `TESTING_EXPLORER.md`.

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Automated Tests Cover:

| Component | Tests |
|-----------|-------|
| **Service Health** | Health endpoints, metrics, basic connectivity |
| **Block API** | Get by latest/number/hash, data consistency |
| **Transaction API** | Details, receipts, trace (tree/steps) |
| **Search API** | Block/tx/address search |
| **Address API** | Contract detection, tx count, last seen |
| **Web UI** | Page accessibility, routing |
| **Integration** | RPC vs API data consistency |

### Manual Tests Cover:

| Feature | Tests |
|---------|-------|
| **UI Navigation** | Clicking through blocks/txs/addresses |
| **Search UX** | User input handling, error states |
| **Visual Checks** | Data display, formatting, readability |
| **Error Handling** | Invalid inputs, missing data |
| **Performance** | Page load times, API response times |

## 🎯 What Each Script Does

### `test_explorer.sh` 
**Purpose:** Validate all Explorer functionality is working  
**When to use:** After starting Docker services  
**Time:** ~30 seconds  
**Result:** Pass/fail report with details

### `preflight_check.sh`
**Purpose:** Validate environment before starting services  
**When to use:** Before running `docker compose up`  
**Time:** ~5 seconds  
**Result:** Ready/not-ready with specific issues

### `validate_code.sh`
**Purpose:** Validate code structure and configuration  
**When to use:** After code changes, before Docker  
**Time:** ~3 seconds  
**Result:** Valid/invalid with errors and warnings

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Validate everything
./validate_code.sh && ./preflight_check.sh

# Start services (fork mode)
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml up --build

# Run tests (in another terminal)
./test_explorer.sh

# Check specific service logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml logs explorer-api
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml logs explorer-web

# Restart a service
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml restart explorer-api

# Stop all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml down

# Stop and remove volumes (fresh start)
docker compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml down -v
```

✅ **All file structure checks passed**
- All Explorer API source files present
- All Explorer Web pages present
- All Dockerfiles present
- All configuration files present

✅ **All JSON syntax checks passed**
- package.json files valid
- tsconfig.json files valid

✅ **Docker Compose configuration validated**
- explorer-api service configured correctly
- explorer-web service configured correctly
- sourcify service present
- All environment variables set
- Volumes configured

✅ **Dockerfile checks passed**
- Both use proper Node.js base images
- Dependencies installed correctly
- Builds configured
- Ports exposed

✅ **All required dependencies present**
